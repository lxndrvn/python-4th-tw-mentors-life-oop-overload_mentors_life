EXAMPLE

    First we start with the counting the students, if the energy level is low, the mentors tells us to do some gym exercises.
    Than the education starts, and we would make a project.
    Next this there will be an exam, where if you don't get enough points, you will be fired.
    After that we check the happiness level, which will be low, so mentors suggest to make a break, drink coffee, and smoke a cigarette, which will increase our happiness level and check it again, if it still low, then Dani will make a pole dance.
    Later that everybody is happy, we take a private mentoring session which will consist of checking knowledge level, mentoring and checking the level again.
    After there will be a peer mentoring, where everybody's happiness and knowledge level will be higher. Later start a lunch time where the energy and happiness level will increase.
    Than we will start a retrospective event, where the mentors get back a feedback.
    After this there will be a foosball match.
    Finally some students do yoga, some students go to squash, or to drink a beer and this will increase or decrease energy and happiness level.
